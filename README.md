# Experiments with Mixed Curvature VAE
This project was done as part of the course CS726 at IIT Bombay. 

Generative modeling tasks involve learning a probability distribution over a latent space of variables, which are typically assumed to be in Euclidean spaces due to their simplicity. However, certain types of data, such as human interpretable images and speech, exhibit non-Euclidean structures, and the quality of the representations achieved depends on how well the geometry of the latent space matches the structure of the data. To address this issue, recent research has focused on exploring the use of non-Euclidean geometries to better capture the intrinsic structure of such data. We focus on these aspects in this project.
